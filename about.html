        <h2>School History</h2>
        <p>
            Hosanna Secondary School was founded in <strong>1999</strong> by a group of
            dedicated educationists with the vision of providing quality education rooted
            in discipline, integrity, and academic excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The school started with a small student population and limited facilities.
            Through commitment, community support, and strong leadership, it has grown
            into a well-established institution offering both O-Level and A-Level
            education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Hosanna Secondary School stands as a respected centre of learning,
            producing disciplined, responsible, and academically competent students.
